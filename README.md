Project Name
# Stock Modeling
This project will predict daily closing and moving average prices of a stock and attempt to calculate its crossover point and potential.

# Business Case: Predictive Modeling for Stock Prices

## Overview:
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that will analyze the daily closing and moving average prices of a given stock and attempt to calculate its crossover point and potential. This project is intended for investors and traders who are looking for an edge in the stock market.

## Problem Statement:
The stock market is volatile, and predicting the movement of stock prices is notoriously difficult. Investors and traders are constantly looking for ways to gain an edge, and predictive modeling has become an increasingly popular tool for achieving this goal. However, not all predictive models are created equal, and investors and traders need to be able to trust the accuracy of the models they use.

## Solution:
Our team will develop a predictive model that uses historical data to predict the daily closing and moving average prices of a given stock. The model will be trained using machine learning algorithms, and will take into account a range of factors that could influence the movement of stock prices.

The model will also calculate the crossover point for the stock, which is the point at which the moving average price intersects with the closing price. This is an important indicator for investors and traders, as it can signal a change in the direction of the stock price.

In addition, the model will attempt to calculate the potential of the stock, which is the difference between the current price and the projected price based on the model’s analysis. This will help investors and traders to make more informed decisions about buying and selling the stock.

## Benefits:
The predictive model will provide investors and traders with a powerful tool for analyzing stock prices and making informed decisions. By accurately predicting the daily closing and moving average prices of a given stock, as well as calculating its crossover point and potential, the model will help investors and traders to optimize their investment strategies and maximize their returns.

## Conclusion:
In today’s fast-paced and unpredictable stock market, having access to accurate and reliable predictive modeling is essential for investors and traders. Our team’s predictive model for stock prices will provide a valuable tool for anyone looking to gain an edge in the market, and we are confident that it will be well-received by investors and traders alike.
